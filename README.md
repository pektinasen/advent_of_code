# Advent of Code

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2017](https://adventofcode.com/2017) in Scala (compiled with dotty).

Have look around, but don't cheat ;)

## Day One

Sum up numbers in list that have same right neighbor

So for the first task I already use the quick solution. I hope followup solutions will be more elegant.


## sbt project compiled with Dotty

### Usage

This is a normal sbt project, you can compile code with `sbt compile` and run it
with `sbt run`, `sbt console` will start a Dotty REPL.

For more information on the sbt-dotty plugin, see the
[dotty-example-project](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty-example-project/blob/master/README.md).
